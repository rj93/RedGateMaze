# RedGateMaze
## What is this?

Whilst looking for graduate schemes during my final year, I came across Redgate's graduate program. If I wanted to apply I could either send over a CV and a cover letter, or I could complete a programming challenge they set. I opted for the latter, and this repo is the outcome.

## What was the challenge?

The challenge was to generate a maze. I could use any language I wanted, and the only constraint was that I'd have to be able to demonstrate what I've done and how I'd done it.

## So how did you do it?

When I first thought found the challenge, the biggest problem I would face was how I would visualize the maze as I haven't had much GUI experience. This lead me in the direction of creating the maze as a web page as I have fairly good knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, and I could quickly create a prototype.

I decided I would use [recursive backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Recursive_backtracker) as the algorithm to generate the maze.

As a little extra, I implemented the A* search algorithm to solve the maze.
